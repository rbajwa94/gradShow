      <p class="avenir write-up-size para-size margin-for-write-up">My name is Dale Garcia. I am from Cebu, Philippines and I am in the Communication Design 
        program. Before North Island College, I was working as a freelance video editor and colorist 
        for short films and reality TV shows and studying my Bachelors in Integrated Marketing 
        Communications. In my program, I enjoyed the fact that our teachers were not only hands on, 
        but also gave us enough creative freedom to help us find our style. The biggest thing I have 
        learned from the program is how to appreciate different styles of design and then eventually 
        find my own. After graduation I plan to pursue graphic design as a career and continue pursuing 
        video editing and photography when the opportunity arises.
